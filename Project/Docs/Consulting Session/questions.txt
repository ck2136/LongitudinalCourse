#Questions for Dr. Strand

2. Is it OK to have treatment step 0 as treatmentstep 6 in order to get proportional oddsd referenced to step 0?
1. How do we make contrasts statements for identifying the odds of Treatment step (compared to reference trt_step 5, highest trt step)
3. What does it mean when the F value goes to infinity (i.e. in the H2 where interaction term)?
4. Does my hypothesis need to be more specific? Or can I just give a general description based on the significance of variables to the outcomes?

*Recommendations
1. Recategorize the treatment steps
2. Double check if sample size is 1000
3. Try separate 1000 sample to make sure something crazy isn't going on
4. Try 500 or even 300
5. How does changing the order of polynomials change the effect
6. Run a loess procedure on time to determine if there 
7. Sensitivity approach covariates look at the estimate of those variables when adding or subtacting time terms 

Point is to try to get estimates! standard errors and F values
Process is to start small
